# Machince Learning Algorithm
## Random Forest
Random Forest is a versatile machine-learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. It operates by constructing a multitude of decision trees during training and outputs the mode of the classes (classification) or the mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees.

Each decision tree is constructed by selecting a random subset of features from the dataset and then determining the best split based on these features. This process helps to de-correlate the trees, reducing the risk of overfitting and increasing the model's robustness.

During prediction, the Random Forest aggregates the predictions of all individual trees to arrive at a final prediction, either by voting (for classification) or averaging (for regression). This ensemble approach tends to produce more accurate and stable predictions compared to individual decision trees. Random Forest is widely used due to its simplicity, flexibility, and effectiveness across various types of datasets.

### Accuracy
- With the dataset used, the accuracy of this random forest model came out to 88%.

## How to run code?
- Download the file (.ipynb or .py) and run in your desirable IDE.
- Using the .ipynb file in Google Colab is advisable.
- Ensure that the dataset is uploaded and copy the path and enter it at the correct position.
